setup   choose AI access and optional phone access; keep existing bots and chats
start   same as openbot: use your saved settings and open the workspace
serve   starts the server without prompts; in a terminal it prints a pairing
        code, the link to paste into the desktop app (＋ → Connect to a
        server) and a QR for a phone
pair    a new pairing code for the running server, with its link and QR
        (--phone: chat and approvals only; --ttl keeps it open up to 24h,
        still single use)
devices lists paired devices; "devices revoke ID" signs one out
status  the running server, the address others reach it at, and whether
        that address answers as this server
login   signs this machine in to an OpenBot account (an emailed code)
        and reserves its public address for --tunnel
logout  releases that address and signs out
access  who may sign in with an emailed code at /pair: an address or
        @domain; --chat-only gives chat and approvals without settings.
        Takes effect at once, no restart.
service keep the server running across reboots: writes a systemd unit
        (Linux) or a launchd agent (macOS) for the same serve options and
        prints the commands that install it. Run from npx, it first
        installs a copy of this version next to your data for the service.
browser install: the bots' browser engine (agent-browser, pinned) into the
        data dir, and Chrome for Testing into the user's browser cache.
        --with-deps also installs
        the Linux libraries Chrome needs (run as root once). Then run
        browser install as the user running serve, from that user's home.
        status: what the current user and data directory have.
fleet   many client workspaces on one Linux server, each its own account,
        service, data folder, brand, sign-in list and keys at NAME.HOST
        behind the system Caddy. Plans are printed unless run as root;
        --dry-run always prints. Install the package permanently first.
        init --operator USER also installs the fleet agent, a root service
        on a Unix socket only USER may open, so the workspace running as
        USER manages the others from Settings → Installations.

Ways in (pick one; --lan can join any):
--public-url you already have HTTPS in front (cloudflared, Caddy, nginx):
             the link uses that address, after checking it reaches this
             server. http:// is accepted only for a private network address.
--lan        this network only, plain http: listens on this machine's
             private addresses and answers nobody on the open internet
--tailscale  serve over your tailnet: Tailscale terminates HTTPS and the
             link uses this machine's MagicDNS name (needs Tailscale signed in
             and HTTPS certificates enabled for the tailnet); the share ends
             when serve stops
--tunnel     serve at a public https://c-… address through a
             Cloudflare tunnel: no domain, no proxy, no open port. Run
             \`openbot login\` once on this machine first.
--domain     serve at https://HOST on your own domain: a pinned Caddy is
             downloaded once and run alongside the server, and gets the
             certificate itself. Point the domain's DNS at this machine and
             open ports 80 and 443.

--no-open   do not open a browser window
--no-pair   do not print a pairing code
--local     start locally this time, ignoring saved remote-access settings

${HEADLESS_USAGE}

Install once with \`npm install -g openbot\`, then type \`openbot\`.
Or run without a global install: \`npx openbot\`. Node 24+ is required.
